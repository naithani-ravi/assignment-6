<h1>Welcome to Learning the Web Technology</h1>
<p>Web development is an evolving amalgamation of languages that work in concert to receive, modify, and deliver information between parties using the Internet as a mechanism of delivery.</p>
<p>While it is easy to describe conceptually, implementation is accompanied by an overwhelming variety of languages, platforms, templates, frameworks, guidelines, and standards. Navigating a project from concept to completion often requires more than mastery of one or two complementing languages, meaning today’s developers need both breadth, and depth, of knowledge to be effective.</p>

<h2>HTML-5</h2>
<article>
<p>So what is HTML5, really? Basically, it’s about extending HTML/XHTML with new more semantically rich elements, deprecating attributes, introducing new attributes and altering how some element and attributes are allowed to be used. Hand in hand with that is the possibility to use attributes for WAI-ARIA to make a web page more accessible, such as with landmark roles.</p>

<h2>CSS_3</h2>
<article>
<p>The biggest change that is currently planned with CSS level 3 is the introduction of modules. The advantage to modules is that it (supposedly) allows the specification to be completed and approved more quickly, because segments are completed and approved in chunks. This also allows browser and user-agent manufacturers to support sections of the specification but keep their code bloat to a minimum by only supporting those modules that make sense.</p>
<p>For example, a text reader wouldn't need to include modules that only define how an element is going to display visually. But even if it only included the aural modules, it would still be a standards-compliant CSS 3 tool.</p>

<h2>JAVASCRIPT</h2>
<article>
<p>JavaScript was initially created to “make webpages alive”.</p>
<p>The programs in this language are called scripts. They can be written right in the HTML and execute automatically as the page loads.</p>
<p>Scripts are provided and executed as a plain text. They don’t need a special preparation or a compilation to run.</p>
<p>In this aspect, JavaScript is very different from another language called Java.</p>
